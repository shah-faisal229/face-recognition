# face-recognition
The main goal of this project is to create a Face Recognition-based attendance system that will turn this manual process into an automated one using Python and Open CV.

This project meets the requirements for bringing modernization to the way attendance is handled, as well as the criteria for time management. 
This device is installed in the classroom, where and student's information, such as name, roll number, class, sec, and photographs, is trained. The images are extracted using Open CV. Before the start of the corresponding class, the student can approach the machine, which will begin taking pictures and comparing them to the qualified datasets.
